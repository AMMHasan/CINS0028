### Introduction
This notebook introduces some basic Linux commands for navigating directories, managing files, dealing with permissions and working with text files.


### Printing a message on the terminal (or save it in a file)
We use `echo` to print a message followed by the message in quotes.

```{bash}

echo "Hello, World!"

```

### Basic Directory Navigation

To get started with navigating through directories, letâ€™s look at some essential commands.

The `pwd` command prints the current working directory.

```{bash}

pwd

```

The `ls`command lists files and directories in the current directory. You can use flags like `-l` for detailed information or `-a` to show hidden files.

```{bash}
# Listing Files and Directories

ls -l

# Including hidden files

ls -la

```

Use the cd command to change directories. For example, to move to the home directory:

```{bash}
# Changing Directories

# Go to the home directory

cd ~

# or simply

cd

# Move up one directory

cd ..

```

### Working with Files and Directories 
To create a new directory, use `mkdir` followed by the directory name. To create a new file, use `touch` followed by the file name. To move or rename a file, use `mv` followed by the file name and the new location or name. To copy a file, use `cp` followed by the file name and the new location. But, in the case of copying a folder (or directory), use `cp -r` command. To delete a file, use `rm` followed by the file name. To delete a directory, use `rm -r` followed by the directory name.

```{bash}
# Creating Files and Directories
 
mkdir my_new_directory

touch my_new_file.txt

# Moving and Renaming Files

mv my_new_file.txt my_new_directory/

mv my_new_directory/my_new_file.txt my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt


# Copying Files

cp my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt copy_of_file.txt

# Copy directory recursively

cp -r my_new_directory/ copy_of_directory/

# Deleting Files and Directories

rm copy_of_file.txt

rm -r copy_of_directory/

```


### Viewing and Editing Files
There several commands to view and edit files. The `cat` command displays the entire file. The `less` command displays a file one page at a time. The `head` command displays the beginning of a file, and the `tail` command displays the end of a file. The `vim` command opens a file in the vim text editor.
```{bash}
# Viewing total file contents

cat my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

# for viewing a chunck of a file at a time, use less. For structured text files, like tables, use -S parameter

less my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt


# Display beginning of the file (first 10 lines). You can select how many lines to display by using -n parameter

head my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

# Display end of the file (last 10 lines). You can select how many lines to display by using -n parameter

tail my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

# Editing Files with nano (interactive, opens in terminal) or vim 

vim my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

```

### Searching for files
Finding a file is often necessary in a directory with many files. The `find` command searches for files in a directory and its subdirectories. You can specify how many layers of subdirectories to search. For example, to search for a file named `renamed_file.txt` in the current directory and its subdirectories:
```{bash}
find . -name "renamed_file.txt"

find . -maxdepth 3 -name "renamed_file.txt"

```

### Searching a text in a file and other utilities for interrogating a text file
The `grep` command searches for a text pattern in a file. The `sed` command replaces a text pattern with another text. The `cut` command extracts a column from a text file. The `sort` command sorts a text file. The `uniq` command removes duplicate lines from a text file. The `wc` command counts the number of lines (`-l`), words (`-w`), and characters in a text file.

```{bash}
grep "Hello" my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

sed 's/Hello/Hi/g' my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

cut -d " " -f 1 my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

sort my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

uniq my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

wc my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

wc -l my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt


```

### Piping and Redirection
Piping and redirection are powerful features in Linux. Piping allows you to send the output of one command to another command. Redirection allows you to send the output of a command to a file. For example, to list files in the current directory and search for a file named `renamed_file.txt`:

```{bash}

# Piping

ls -l | grep "renamed_file.txt"

# Redirection

ls -l > my_new_directory/file_list.txt

```

### Downloading files from the internet
You can download files from the internet using the `wget` command followed by the URL of the file. For example, to download a file named `README.md` from a GitHub repository:

```{bash}

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmhasan/Path/main/README.md

```


### Permissions
Remember that this is a slippery slope. Be careful when changing permissions on files and directories.

```{bash}
# Viewing Permissions

ls -l my_new_directory/

# Changing Permissions
chmod +x my_new_directory/renamed_file.txt

```

### Conclusion
These basic Linux commands are foundation for file and directory management. With practice, you'll find navigating and managing files in Linux more intuitive.
